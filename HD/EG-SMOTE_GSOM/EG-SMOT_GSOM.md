### Motivation and Problem Formulation

**Problem**
* Complexity of dynamic threat detection at the Edge for IoT devices
* Widespread adoption of IoT applications stresses the impact and vulnerability to cyber attacks.

* Unlabeled data
* Unbalanced datasets

**Challenges**
* Signature based detection requires frequent updates and can be circumvented with obfuscation techniques.
* Knowledge and Statistical based detection requires balanced and labeled data.
**Missing from Previous Work**

**Key Assumptions**
* Few Shot Learning (FSL) requires balanced data
* Granular Computing (GrC) needs to be combined with deep learning techniques
* Blockchain requires human intervention and is mainly good for preventing counterfeiting
* SMOTE creates larger and less specific decision limits
